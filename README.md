This is a Tic Tac Toe game written in python. I am in progress of creating multiple variations to the game but as of 1/2/2021 I have the functionality of Person vs. Computer. This is an unbeatable A.I. which utalizes the powerful Minimax with Alpha/Beta pruning algorithm to determine the move which will most maximize the computer's utility. I plan to implement a Computer vs. Computer simulaiton to showcase the Minimax algorithm where the game will tie every run, and also a Person vs. Person game which allows two people to play against each other. 
Creating an unbeatable AI for Tic Tac Toe is something I have been wanting to create ever since High School. I never truly could wrap my head around the correct algorithm, but after taking CMPSC 442: Artificial Intelligence at Penn State, I finally got over the hump and was able to truly understand how it all works. I am very proud of this and am looking forward to contuing my studies and improving my code.
